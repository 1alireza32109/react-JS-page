        Smart contracts run as part of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs), which is fully an open-source platform. It allows people from outside the community to bring their own ideas and be voted for implementation by the coin-holders. It ensures higher level of transparency in the system.

        In addition, Expanse has its own rewards system - Expanse Rewards. It distributes equal amount reward in EXP tokens among the coin-holders regardless of their investment.

        Expanse offers compatibility with the more secure hardware wallets – Ledger Nano S and Trezor.

        Having the smart contract system increases the security since it eliminates few risks on both technical and human sides. A nominal fee for executing bits of smart contract data prevents hackers from attacking the Network with Denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attacks or Infinite loops. On the human side, smart contract technology eliminates trust issues. To business unites can agree upon the conditions and prepare a contract. When certain conditions are met, the contract is triggered automatically and both parties benefit without worrying about the execution.

        It is considered to be one of the safest projects out there. Tezos uses its own language for smart contracts. It allows ratifying the security of a contract mathematically proving it which lays one more layer of protection over the project. On top of that, with its self-amending algorithm, any mistake in the network can be corrected in the shortest time.

        Cardano Ada is more reliable than other cryptocurrencies for several reasons.
        First is the fact of it being developed by a team of academics and engineers. However, the development of technology used in Cardano did not end with its launch. In order to ensure its constant technological progress, the developers formed a treasury consisting of transaction fees, small enough to be insignificant to its users. Yet the funds keep growing and new resources can constantly be invested into Ada development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The updates themselves are non-intrusive. In order for an update to be implemented, developers have to submit an update proposal for community members to vote on. This ensures that when making any changes to the system, it is done with the best interest of the community in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Cardano is more acceptable for financial institutions enrolled in traditional banking. This is because with Ada, user metadata can be provided with the transaction if needed. User data is vital in strictly regulated traditional banking. Having the option of providing transaction metadata is what makes Cardano more flexible than most other cryptocurrencies in this regard.

      <p>Ethereum ensures safety via the so-called gas technology.</p>
      <p>Each operation in a smart contract requires a certain amount of gas while its amount in the block is limited. It makes the creation of the infinitely complex smart contract impossible: because the gas is fee-based, and the network is protected from spam.</p>
      <p>The smart contract technology increases the security level in the business transaction as it gives partners an opportunity to run their business without relying on each other’s good intentions: all the settings are specified in the smart contract and thus are not likely to change spontaneously. As a result, technology makes all the trust issues irrelevant.</p>
